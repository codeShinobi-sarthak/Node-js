Blog 1: Understanding the MERN Stack: A Beginner’s Guide
The MERN stack is a popular choice for developers looking to build full-stack web applications. It consists of MongoDB, Express.js, React, and Node.js. Let’s break down each component and understand why MERN has become so popular.

MongoDB
MongoDB is a NoSQL database that stores data in flexible, JSON-like documents. Unlike traditional SQL databases, MongoDB allows for a more dynamic, schema-less data structure, which is perfect for applications with varying data types.

Express.js
Express.js is a lightweight web application framework for Node.js. It simplifies the process of building robust and scalable server-side applications, offering a set of tools and utilities for handling requests, routing, and middleware.

React
React is a JavaScript library developed by Facebook for building user interfaces. It allows developers to create reusable UI components, manage the state efficiently, and build complex UIs with ease.

Node.js
Node.js is a runtime environment that allows you to run JavaScript on the server side. It’s built on Chrome’s V8 engine and provides an event-driven, non-blocking I/O model, making it efficient and suitable for scalable applications.

Why Choose MERN?
The MERN stack offers a cohesive development experience, allowing you to use JavaScript for both front-end and back-end development. This consistency speeds up the development process and makes it easier for developers to switch between different parts of the stack.
