# Node.js Learning Journey

## Overview

This repository contains my learning materials and projects related to Node.js. Through various resources and projects, I've gained experience in several key areas of Node.js development.

## Key Learnings

### Node.js Fundamentals
- Core concepts of Node.js, including the event loop and asynchronous programming.
- Using Node.js modules and the npm ecosystem.

### Express.js
- Building web applications and APIs with Express.js.
- Handling routes, middleware, and error management.
- Implementing authentication and session management.

### MongoDB
- Integrating MongoDB with Node.js applications using Mongoose.
- Performing CRUD operations and managing data schemas.
- Handling data validation and queries.

### API Development
- Creating RESTful APIs with Express.js.
- Implementing data validation, error handling, and response formatting.


### Deployment
- Deploying Node.js applications to cloud platforms.
- Configuring environment variables and managing application settings.

## Blog Application

To apply my learning, I developed a blog application that demonstrates these skills.

- **db/**: Contains configuration files, such as database connection settings.
- **models/**: Defines Mongoose schemas for MongoDB collections (e.g., blog posts, users).
- **routes/**: Manages route definitions for different functionalities (e.g., auth, posts, users).
- **views/**: Includes EJS templates for rendering the frontend.
- **public/**: Contains static files such as CSS and JavaScript.

## File Organization

This repository also includes a script that organizes files by their extensions into separate folders. The script performs the following tasks:

- **Reads Files**: Retrieves all files in the specified directory.
- **Checks for Folders**: Creates folders for each file extension if they do not already exist.
- **Moves Files**: Moves each file into the corresponding folder based on its extension.
